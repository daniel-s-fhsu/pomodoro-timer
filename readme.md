Pomodoro Timer

The prototype PWA allows the user to time events.  When fully implemented, it will time the user for a 25-minute focus session and then a 5-minute break.

It will track the usage stats per user and upload those for display on a statistics page.

It should run when published.  To run in a dev environment, make sure node is installed and run
"npx serv ."
from inside the application directory.
